			<h3>About the Charity</h3>
			<div class="well charity-details">
				<p>
					Thanks to the Alice Ferguson Foundation, there's a special place in Maryland where students from throughout the region can dig in the dirt, take a hike, and catch an unbeatable glimpse of the Potomac. That place is Hard Bargain Farm, which annually hosts nearly 6,000 K-8 students who come to interact with plants and animals about which many of them have &mdash; until now &mdash; only read. Nearly 4,000 students take part in Bridging the Watershed, a program that takes students to national and state parks in the Potomac Watershed where they learn, hands&dash;on, about how a watershed works and how to keep it clean. Another 14,000 volunteers at nearly 700 sites throughout the Watershed (in four states and the District) participate in a day&dash;long cleanup of the River as part of AFF's comprehensive Trash Free Potomac Watershed Initiative. Each year, AFF helps thousands of people connect with nature by milking a cow or picking up a piece of trash along the river.
