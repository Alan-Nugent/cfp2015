  Steve Pearlstein's annual column "celebrates those companies and their employees that have continued to contribute their time, money, and ingenuity to local charitable causes." The article mentions the Catalogue's partnerships with the Wal-Mart Foundation and CGI Federal, which, in the last year, have supported a dozen Catalogue nonprofits. CGI Federal also has been instrumental in developing our new portal. Booz Allen Hamilton, a new Catalogue investor in 2008-09, also is featured among 50 companies recognized for "extraordinary acts of corporate philanthropy."

  <strong>Sun Dec 7 2008</strong>
  The <i>Washington Post's</i> Close to Home op-ed page features an article that highlights the Catalogue's partnership with CGI Federal and our new co-branded portal. It begins, "Workplace philanthropy campaigns during the holidays need to be given the pink slip. This shortsighted fundraising model not only gets lost in the sea of December personal spending; it also encourages a one-shot approach to doing good that limits the ability of service agencies and nonprofits to meet dire year-round needs. Even when the  economy is doing well, concentrated giving during a single, compressed time period makes little sense. It's not as if poverty, homelessness, hunger and health issues disappear after the holidays." The portal is described as a good corporate model for cultivating deep and lasting donor-recipient partnerships. The Catalogue's other Portal Partners are TTR Sotheby's International Realty and Booz Allen Hamilton.

  <strong>Sat Dec 6 2008</strong>
  Reports of bare cupboards at food pantries, and a growing list of clients in need, has everyone appropriately concerned. But worry can be turned to good purpose. Today the Catalogue has posted to its website a "<a href='http://www.cfp-dc.org/cfp/group_list.php?id=1'>Safety Net List</a>" of Catalogue organizations that focus on food, clothing, shelter, and medical care. Donors can find, by name, kind, and location, 44 nonprofits in the metropolitan region that work with the most vulnerable among us.

  <strong>Wed Oct 15 2008</strong>
  In the mid-1990s, Barbara Harman and her husband, William Cain, enjoyed a spike in the value of some stocks they'd held for years. Longtime college professors, they'd already set aside enough money for their own retirement, so they decided to give away most of the unexpected windfall -- about $400,000. Then came the tough part: determining how best to donate their money. It's an enviable challenge, and one a growing number of older Americans are facing.
